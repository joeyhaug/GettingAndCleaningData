# GettingAndCleaningData
# My first step was to install and load the required packages needed for the project.
I then set my working directory to the folder in which all my data was saved. Then all of the data was combined into one data set. I then changed the column names of the dataset with the labels that matched the code. I then made my tidy_data set and eliminated all of the columns that contained the mean frequency data. It then loads the tidydata into a data frame and prints to a .txt file.
